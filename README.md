# Installation of Anaconda (Optional)
OmicsOne was developed under conda virtual environment. 
Here is a step by step tutorial for install Anaconda 3 and run OmicsOne under conda environment.
OmicsOne has been upgraded to support Python 3.8 and stop supporting Python 3.6. Please note all the followintg "3.6" should be changed to "3.8" in the screen shots.
The video tutorial can be found in https://youtu.be/HOGLNm02qCk.
You can also choose to install OmicsOne in an existed Python 3.8 environment (Skip Step.1-4) without install Anaconda 3.
1. Download and install Anacoda 3 (https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual), and scroll down to the bottom of the front page <br>
